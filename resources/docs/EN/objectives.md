This project has the aim of responding to aneed or a gap that we have when documenting and organizing the search for missing persons, especially when a large number of people are participating in the search.Organizing and documenting a service involving many emergency teams is a very complex task and requires the mastery of a variety of computer tools, which in many cases do not allow the exchange of live information nor permit different people to work on the same file simultaneously. Furthermore, after each search is concluded, the data is stored in digital or paper archives, which significantly complicates later analysis.
The aim of this web app is to overcome these shortcomings.

## [Objectives in detail](/{{route}}/{{version}}/objectives#details)
* To create a single database where the data from each search is stored.
* To create an intuitive and simple environment, where users with less experience will be also able to work effectively.
* To create a database with which different people will be able to work simultaneously.
* To create a database that allows users to work from different locations.
* To integrate the database into a GIS from where the action plan and the subsequent follow-up can be undertaken.
* To create tools from where the users will be able to attach GPS tracks of the response teams to validate the tasks performed.
* To create a tool to generate reports and search maps easily.
* To create tools to view and extract statistics from this database.
* To create a table to enter data from previous searches.
* To create a tool that identifies patterns of behaviour based on the profiles of the missing person.
* To create a dynamic vulnerability table from the search data.
